Exampool aims to implement features such as: 

- Creating Flashcards, Notes, and Quizzes
    - Quizzes will be implemented by going through flashcards and answering questions on the flashcard, with the answer at the back
- Searching for these resources

To implement these features, we implemented a three-tier architecture for Exampool. This three-tier architecture consists of a Presentation layer (Android Interface), a Logic layer (Java Source code) and a Persistence layer (through HSQLDB).
