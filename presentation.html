      <h2 id="vision-statement">Vision Statement</h2>
      <p>ExamPOOL is an android application for students that facilitates the creation, sharing and studying of course notes and practice quizzes all in one convenient platform. Gone are the days of hauling around packets of index cards and begging classmates for a copy of their course notes. ExamPOOL consolidates the very best features from the most popular student study aid platforms, allowing students to focus on the material instead of where to find it.
      </p>
      <p>
        ExamPOOL is primarily designed for student use. Students will be able to find, upload, edit and share lecture notes from their courses. Students who upload their notes will have the choice of sharing it with students in their class, students in their school, and students interested in the subject matter, or they may choose who may have access to the notes. Students may also allow some of their material to be accessed globally – meaning, anyone with an account can view that specific material.
      </p>
      <p>
        Students will be able to find, create, share, and attempt practice quizzes for their courses. Students who want to share their practice quizzes will have the same control over who can view them as they do when uploading notes. Students who attempt practice quizzes will be given feedback on their attempts and will be able to compare their scores against all previous attempts. Moreover, these quizzes give the students a chance to focus on their weak points. The newly generated quizzes would contain previous questions that the students may have gotten wrong, allowing them to improve upon their foundational knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        ExamPOOL is envisioned primarily as a mobile application with the opportunity of developing an extended web-based platform in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        ExamPOOL is an improvement over the current architecture, which forces students to use multiple apps and other platforms to keep track of their schoolwork. Additionally, the current framework requires the students to refer to a different set of channels for different subjects whereas ExamPOOL would allow students to contain all their needs in one platform. As a result, the clutter of study materials required will be simplified – allowing students to concentrate solely on the materials they need. Furthermore, the new system would allow students to study the same amount of content in a shorter time period, giving them a stronger chance to balance their time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project will be considered successful if at least 40% of users prefer our system compared to using multiple applications, as determined by a user survey, and if the performance of students will improve by at least 15% from their current level, as determines by grades and overall performance on their quizzes in ExamPOOL.

      <h2 id="users">Intended Users</h2>
      <p> The application is intended primarily for students.</p>
      <p> Teachers or professors are also able to use it to build their class material.</p>

      <h2 id="major-functionality">Major Functionality</h2>
      <h3 id="flashcards">Flashcards</h3>
      <p>
        The student can create, edit, and delete flashcards which contain different types of questions. The types of questions currently implemented are:  
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Multiple Choice Questions</li>
        <li>True or False Questions</li>
        <li>Typed Answer Questions</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The student is also able to view all of the flashcards in an organized menu</p>
      <h3 id="quiz">Quizing</h3>
      <p>
        The student can iterate through the flashcards, answering questions as they go. The flashcards are implemented as flashcards are used in real life. The question is at the front of the flashcard and the answer is at the back. The student would click on "Sublit answer" to see the flashcard flip to reveal the answer. They can opt to move to the next question directly without flipping the flashcard and the score will still increase if they typed the right answer. 
      </p>
      <p>
        At the end of the iteration, the student will get a simple page indicating the end of the flashcards along with the result of their iteration. They will also have the option to restart the quiz or go back to the flashcards page. 
      </p>
      <h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>
      <p>
        The student can create, edit, and delete notes. They can also view all of the notes.
