how to run it, and links to other important project documentation (like your VISION.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, and RETROSPECTIVE.md files).

The purpose of this project is to implement an app that students can use to supplement their studying. It has 2 main features: notes and flashcards (with questions). 

The student can view, create, edit and delete the notes and flashcards. They can also iterate through the flashcards (through the start quiz button) which allows the student to answer the questions on the flashcards (and flip the flashcard over to see the correct flashcard) while generating a score.
